<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the project
This project is part of a bigger project : Charge tests on MariaDB Server. Being a ISO 27001 certified company we have to respect the customer's privacy. Thus, we have to generate our databases with synthetic data. since we bought SDV enterprise and have a specific relational database strucfture, SDV doesn't have a SQL query table loader so we have to create a SQL to SDV converter. Moreover, this able us to extend the synthetic data generation project further within the company.
